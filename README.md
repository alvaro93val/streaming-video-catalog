### QUESTIONS

How did you decide on the technical and architectural options used as part of your solution?
They are the technologies that I have used the most and I think they are the most efficient for the test.

Are there any improvements I can make to your shipment?
Yes, I haven't been able to finish it on time, I had a little delay in initializing the project, but I hope to finish it in a short time.

What would you do differently if you were given more time?
It would make the architecture cleaner and clearer in addition to implementing testing.
